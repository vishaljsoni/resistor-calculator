## Milestone
Sprint 1

## Description
Create a graybox version of the hub island where players will start their journey. This is a prototype level using simple geometry to test gameplay flow, scale, and navigation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Hub island layout with distinct zones (dock, town square, training area)
- [ ] Navigable terrain with proper collision
- [ ] At least 3 points of interest marked for future content
- [ ] Spawn point for player character
- [ ] Simple NPC placement markers (no AI needed yet)
- [ ] Quest giver location markers
- [ ] Transition point to first gameplay area
- [ ] Scale feels appropriate for player movement speed

## Technical Notes
- Use Unity ProBuilder or similar for grayboxing
- Keep geometry simple - focus on layout and flow
- Use placeholder materials/colors to distinguish zones
- Document design decisions for art team handoff
- Consider sightlines and player guidance

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code complete and peer reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing (N/A for content)
- [ ] Integration tests passing (level loads without errors)
- [ ] Documentation updated (level design document)
- [ ] Deployed to dev environment
- [ ] QA sign-off received (playtest feedback)
- [ ] No critical or high-severity bugs
- [ ] Level design document with top-down map created
